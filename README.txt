Two simple kid-friendly PWA games:
1) Pocket Patch (girl) - a calm mini garden. Open pocket_patch/index.html
2) Flip & Dash (boy) - a one-touch shape gate runner. Open flip_dash/index.html

Each folder includes a manifest and a service worker placeholder so it can be installed as a PWA on a tablet.
Icons included (192 & 512). To test on a tablet: copy the folder to a web host or open index.html in a browser (some PWA install features require a secure origin - localhost or https).

Enjoy!
